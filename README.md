# Model-For-Lung-Cancer
Lung Cancer Detection from Chest X-ray Images using Deep Learning
Description:
This project presents an automated lung cancer detection system using deep learning and chest X-ray images. Leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with InceptionV3, the model achieves accurate classification of X-ray images as "normal" or "pneumonia." In this context, "pneumonia" serves as a proxy condition for lung cancer during model development. Although pneumonia and lung cancer are distinct medical conditions, pneumonia often exhibits radiological features similar to lung cancer in chest X-rays. By initially training the model on pneumonia data, we lay the foundation for subsequent refinements to enable direct lung cancer detection. The carefully curated dataset comprises 20 epochs of training and validation metrics, which are represented in a line graph with erratic fluctuations, showcasing the model's non-linear performance over time. With promising results and minimal false positives/negatives, the system holds potential for assisting radiologists in early lung cancer detection, contributing to improved patient outcomes and reducing the impact of this devastating disease.
