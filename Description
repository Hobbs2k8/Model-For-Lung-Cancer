Title: Lung Cancer Detection from Chest X-ray Images using Deep Learning
Description:
This project presents an automated lung cancer detection system using deep learning and chest X-ray images. Leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with InceptionV3, the model achieves accurate classification of X-ray images as "normal" or "pneumonia." The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset comprising 20 epochs of training and validation metrics, generating a line graph with erratic fluctuations, demonstrating the model's non-linear performance over time. With promising results and minimal false positives/negatives, the system holds potential for assisting radiologists in early lung cancer detection, contributing to improved patient outcomes and reducing the impact of this devastating disease.
